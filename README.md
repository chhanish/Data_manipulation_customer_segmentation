Customer Duplicate Name Segmentation and Grouping

Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and segmenting customer data to identify and group duplicate customer names within a company's database. The primary goal is to ensure that all references to a particular customer are consolidated under a single name, improving the accuracy and effectiveness of customer analysis. By grouping duplicates together, the project helps in enhancing customer insights, improving data integrity, and enabling more reliable decision-making.

Objective

Identify Duplicate Customer Names: Using advanced data processing techniques, the system scans through customer names and identifies potential duplicates based on various criteria such as exact matches, similar names, or typos.
Group Duplicate Records: Once duplicates are identified, the system groups them under a single, canonical name. This grouping is based on logic like most frequent occurrences, user-specified rules, or heuristics (e.g., prioritizing certain attributes like email addresses or phone numbers).
Improve Data Integrity: By eliminating redundancies and consolidating records, the project enhances the quality of the company's customer database, making it easier to track customer behavior, preferences, and interactions.
Support for Better Customer Analysis: With accurate, non-duplicated customer data, downstream analytics become more reliable, leading to better segmentation, targeted marketing strategies, and improved customer relationship management.
Key Features

Duplicate Detection: Identify and highlight potential duplicates based on name similarity, phonetic similarity (using algorithms like Soundex or Metaphone), and other matching rules.
Customizable Grouping Logic: Offers flexibility in how duplicates are merged, whether by prioritizing certain fields (e.g., email, phone number) or by employing a frequency-based system.
Data Output: Provides clean output with a clear distinction between original and grouped records for further use in analysis, reporting, or integration with CRM systems.
Scalability: Handles large datasets efficiently, ensuring that the customer data is processed in a way that scales with the size of the business.
Analysis and Reporting: Generates reports that show duplicate groups and the action taken, giving visibility into the changes made and ensuring transparency.
Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language for data processing, string matching, and analysis.
Pandas: Data manipulation and transformation library to handle large datasets and perform aggregation tasks.
FuzzyWuzzy / difflib: Used for string matching and similarity scoring to detect potential duplicates.
SQL: For querying customer data and integrating with databases (if applicable).
Jupyter Notebooks: For documentation, testing, and visualizing the grouping process.
How It Works

Data Input: The program takes a dataset of customer records (e.g., name, email, phone number) as input. This data could come from a variety of sources like SQL databases, CSV files, or Excel sheets.
Duplicate Detection: Using similarity algorithms, the program identifies potential duplicate records. The criteria could be exact matches, fuzzy matching (for similar names), or heuristic-based checks (such as matching email or phone numbers).
Duplicate Grouping: Once duplicates are detected, the program groups them under a single unified name. Various methods can be applied to determine which name to keep, such as the most frequent name or a user-defined rule.
Output Data: The cleaned data is saved into a new dataset or database, with duplicate names merged into a single reference, improving overall data quality.
Optional Reporting: Reports are generated to show the changes made and the level of duplication present in the data, providing transparency and insight into the results.
